### Welcome!
These self-guided tutorials are a Python-based introduction to chemical kinetics in the context of organic chemistry.

### How to Use These Tutorials

These tutorials are designed for use with Python 2.x and IPython Notebook (aka. Jupyter). Exercise 0 explains how to install the necessary software.

The PDF and Powerpoint files contain step-by-step instructions.  You should follow along in your browser.

Solutions are also provided.  Download the relevant `.ipynb` file and open it in IPython Notebook.
