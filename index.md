### Welcome!
These self-guided tutorials are a Python-based introduction to chemical kinetics in the context of organic chemistry.

### How to Use These Tutorials

These tutorials are designed for use with Python 2.x and IPython Notebook.  (You can use regular Python instead if you'd like.)  Exercise 0 explains how to install the necessary software.

The PDF and Powerpoint files contain step-by-step instructions.  You should follow along in your browser.

You can also look at the solutions in the IPython Notebooks.  Download the relevant `.ipynb` file and open it your local copy of IPython Notebook.
